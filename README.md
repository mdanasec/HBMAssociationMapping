# HBMAssociationMapping
This project aims to provide a comprehensive example and guide for using Hibernate, a popular Java-based Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) framework, for handling association mappings in your database-backed applications



Creating a simple Maven project in Eclipse involves a few steps. Here are the basic rules and steps to create one:

Prerequisites:

Eclipse IDE: Ensure you have Eclipse IDE for Java or Eclipse IDE for Java EE installed on your system.
Java Development Kit (JDK): Make sure you have a compatible JDK installed. Maven requires Java to run.
Step-by-Step Guide:

Open Eclipse:

Launch Eclipse IDE.
Install the Maven Plugin (if not already installed):

If you haven't already installed the Maven plugin for Eclipse, you can do so by going to
"Help" -> "Eclipse Marketplace" -> "Installed" and then search for "Maven."
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Create a New Maven Project:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Go to "File" -> "New" -> "Other..." to open the "Select a wizard" dialog.
Expand the "Maven" folder and select "Maven Project." Click "Next."
Select a simple project:

Group ID: This is usually your organization's reverse domain name  like org.jsp.
Artifact ID: This is the name of your project.

Click "Finish."
Maven Downloads Dependencies:

Eclipse will create the Maven project and start downloading the required dependencies. 
This process may take a moment, depending on your internet connection.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
View Your Project:

After Maven finishes downloading the dependencies, you will see your project in the Eclipse Project Explorer.
Start Coding: :)

You can now start writing your Java code in the src/main/java directory.
Build the Project:

You can build your project by right-clicking on your project in the Project Explorer and
selecting "Run As" -> "Maven Build." Enter "clean install" as goals and click "Run."Run Your Application:

To run your application, right-click on the main class (usually named App.java) and select "Run As" -> "Java Application."
That's it! You've created a simple Maven project in Eclipse.
You can now start coding and managing your project's dependencies using Maven.

Overview
Welcome to the Hibernate Association Mapping Guide! This project serves as a comprehensive
resource and practical guide for utilizing Hibernate,  a popular Java-based Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) framework, 
to effectively manage association mappings in your database-backed applications.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Project Focus
-
This project is dedicated to helping developers master the intricacies of association mapping within Hibernate. 
Association mapping is the process of defining and managing relationships between entities in a relational database. 
Understanding and correctly implementing these associations is critical for building robust and scalable applications. 
In this guide, you will find:

Detailed Examples: Step-by-step examples illustrating how to configure various types of association mappings, including one-to-one, 
                    one-to-many, many-to-one, and many-to-many relationships.

Sample Application: A hands-on, sample Java application that showcases real-world use cases of association mapping,
                    providing valuable insights for your projects.

Best Practices: A collection of best practices and common pitfalls to help you make informed decisions
                when designing and implementing association mappings.

Getting Started
To begin exploring the world of Hibernate association mappings, simply clone this repository and follow the comprehensive documentation located in the docs directory. 
Ensure that you have Java and Hibernate set up in your development environment.
